# Economic_Time-Series-Analysis_and_Forecasting_ARIMA


The time series analysis concerns the construction production index, which measures the variations in the monthly production volume in Germany from January 1991 to October 2021 (370 observations). The data source is the "Eurostat" website (https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/STS_COPR_M custom_1842339/default/table?lang=en). It provides a measure of the trend in the value added volume over a specific reference period. The main objective of the analysis is to predict the construction production index in the next 12 months.
